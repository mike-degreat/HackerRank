# Task on Arithmetic operators

#  reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# input format: 
# the first line contains the first integer and second line contains second integer

# output format:
# print three lines of code for +, -, *

# here is my code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    print(a + b)
    print(a - b)
    print(a * b)
